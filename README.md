# nuclear-tech-data-analysis

This is a project for ELEN-6909 at Columbia University completed April 2023. This project uses data analysis to investigate the relationship between military nuclear submarine technology development and commercial nuclear power plant development. This report shows that four global superpowers--the United States, China, United Kingdom, and Russia--have predictable periods of commercial nuclear innovation and development approximately two decades after their respective peaks in military nuclear submarine development. 

The [report](military_nuclear_impact_on_commercial_nuclear_tech.pdf) is available in this repository and can be read in the browser.
